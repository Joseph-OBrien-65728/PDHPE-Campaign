        <h2>Features of a safe car</h2>
        <p>It is vital for new drivers to be equipped with a functioning and safe car because they are the most volatile drivers on the roads. Important features include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>ABS</h3></li>
                <p>The ani-lock braking system prevents wheel lockup whilest braking to prevent a car from skidding or losing control.</p>
                <li><h3>Serviced Airbags</h3></li>
                <img src="Demo_Airbags.gif" alt="">
                <p>Airbags protect driver and/or passengers in the case of a crash and it is essential for the airbags to be serviced regularly in order to maintain its funcitonality.</p>
                <li><h3>ESC</h3></li>
                <p>Electronic Stability Control is a feature which monitors and corrects oversteer and understeer. This supports handling in gravel reduces vehicle roll-over.</p>
                <li><h3>Seatbelts</h3></li>
                <img src="Demo_Seatbelts.gif" alt="">
                <p>Whilest it may seem trivial to include, correctly maintained and worn seatbelts are highly effective in reducing injury in an accident. The image shows what could happen in a crash to people who don't wear seatbelts.</p>
                <li><h3>Lights and indicators</h3></li>
                <p>The indicators and lights of your vehicle are the most direct way of signaling intent to surrounding cars. If your signals are malfunctioning, the cars around you have no way of telling where and when you are going to turn. This creates high risk for an accident.</p>
            </ol>
        <h2>How do you be a safe road user?</h2>
        <p>Being a safe road user means being at attention at all times and abiding by road rules. Here are specifities of what would be expected from safe road users:</p>

                    <p class="smallp">Despite contrary belief, crossings are designed so that people in high-traffic areas can safely cross roads. Pedestrians who use crossings are more predictable to drivers, this reduces the risks involved in crossing roads.</p>
                </td>
                <td>
